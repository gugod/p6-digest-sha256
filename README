This is a Perl 6 port of the SHA256 module in Perl 6.

It provides a procedural interface to the 256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm (a.k.a. SHA256).

The source code for Digest::SHA256 is available at <https://github.com/soh-cah-toa/digest-sha256>.

To obtain a local copy of the source code:

    git clone git://github.com/soh-cah-toa/digest-sha256.git


Installation
============

Once you've obtained a copy of the source code:

    ufo             # Creates Makefile
    make            # Builds module
